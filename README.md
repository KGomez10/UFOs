## UFOs Challenge 11
Overview of Project: 

## Overall Analysis:

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Danaâ€™s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. With the additional filter features, users can now filter by the city, state, country, and shape. This allows the user to get a more defined search result when looking for specific UFO sightings on Dana's webpage. 

## Results:

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
With the addition of being able to filter by Date City, State, County and Shape a user can directly pinpoint the exact location of the UFO sighting they are looking for.

Providing these options makes is the site have more variety in search options giving the user a easier method to find the exact sighting they are looking for.

## Summary:

The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage
two recommendations for further development.

Currently a draw back on the site is that once you have filtered the search, a page refresh is needed in order to clear out the save search. Possibly adding a feature where the page will automatically clear out the search options making it easier for users to do various search options without having to constantly refresh the page. 
This will help the visibility and the accessably and usability. 

Users also love looking at images! How fun would it be if when the user clicks on the specific UFO sighting, a pop up with all details comes us as well as an image (if there is one) is available for the user to view. 

* Add google link incase would like to search more options on the UFO sightings  

* Another option to make the page more dynamis is possibly addition a feature where the image of the specific UFO sighting appears.
